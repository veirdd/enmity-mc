SETTINGS AND NOTES

	2. It is recommended to use Fabulous Graphics. (Options -> Video Settings -> Graphics: Fabulous)
	3. English languages should be used (other languages are not supported).

	5. Other than the above, default OptiFine's graphics settings are recommended and compatible.
	6. It is recommended to keep FOV Effects at low values.
	7. Be careful when using Enmity alongside other datapacks as it may cause conflicts.
	8. It is unsupported to run Enmity on servers with engines other than Vanilla installed and is very likely to cause issues.

	   Make sure the pack you want to use doesn't cause that conflict.

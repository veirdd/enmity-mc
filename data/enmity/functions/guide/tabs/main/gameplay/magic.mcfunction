tellraw @s [{"text":"All magic weapons and some enemies with special abilities deal magic damage. It is unaffected by armor and most other conventional protection.\nYour magic damage and magic damage reduction can be increased with the usage of accessories or potions. The Protection enchantment also provides some magic damage reduction (1 per 4 levels).\nMagic damage reduction reduces the magic damage taken, using the following formula:\ndmg_taken = (dmg_input - dmg_rdc) * (1 - dmg_rdc / 50).\nDue to how magic damage boosting methods provide a flat bonus rather than a percentage increase, often rapid fire weapons with low damage value are preferred for offensive loadouts and vice versa.","color":"gray"}]
